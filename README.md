# Telegram Authentication System

## Project Overview
The **Telegram Authentication System** is a web application designed to facilitate Telegram-based user authentication with an accompanying admin dashboard. It provides seamless integration with Telegram's API for user verification and management. The system features an easy-to-use interface, making it ideal for applications requiring secure user login through Telegram.

## Installation

To run the application locally, you'll need to have Node.js and MySQL installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telegram-auth-system.git
   cd telegram-auth-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   Ensure you have a MySQL server running and create a database (e.g., `jaxxynt_wallet`). Update the `db.js` file with your MySQL credentials.

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The application will be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the login page.
- Users can log in using their Telegram accounts.
- Admin functionality can be accessed through the `/admin` route.

## Features
- **Telegram-based Authentication**: Secure user login via Telegram.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, view activity, and handle authentication states.
- **Session Management**: User sessions are securely handled with session cookies.
- **Database Initialization**: Automatic creation of essential tables upon server start.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies, which are managed via `npm` and specified in `package.json`:

- **express**: Web framework for building server-side applications.
- **express-session**: Middleware for managing user sessions.
- **mysql2**: MySQL client for Node.js, allowing interaction with the MySQL database.
- **axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **uuid**: Library for generating unique identifiers.
- **body-parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.
